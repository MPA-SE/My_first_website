**More About My Story**:
It was supposed to be a team project, however, I missed the deadline set to choose team members due to factors that were beyond my control. Yet, I chose to not give up on doing it.
I love languages and so I could think of nothing else but a project focused on languages; especially the French languageüòÅ. 
For the Frontend I chose to use HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript without any additional frameworks. I did not use anything more because I dedicated my time to solidifying my understanding of these three, as I built the project. 
The website is responsive and compatible with mobile.
In the beginning, I was confused. I really did not know where to start. Thank God for ‚ÄúTrello‚Äù! It helped me define my steps. Then, for the how to, I did some research online. And I learnt a lot and I still am learning a lot from freeCodeCamp!
Let me share some of what I‚Äôve learned. HTML is the structure of web design and CSS is the style. What would I have done differently? I would ensure I don‚Äôt miss deadlinesüò≠ What kind of engineer am I? I am the kind who started excited, had some fears along the way, faced tasks even though I was afraid and is learning to do hard things. I am so in love with Frontend nowüòç Now I know why a lot of engineers are Frontend developers.
My name is Priscilla. I am an ALX student: cohort 11.
